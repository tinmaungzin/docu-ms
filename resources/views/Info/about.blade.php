While traditional machine learning techniques are used for NLP, the models built for conversations, called chatbots, are unable to be truly generic. While chatbots have been made with traditional machine learning techniques, deep learning has allowed the complexities within NLP to be easier to model and can be leveraged to build a chatbot which has a real conversation with a human. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP).  Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require handcrafted rules. Recurrent neural networks are one of the staples of deep learning, allowing neural networks to work with sequences of data (text). Modeling conversation is an important task in natural language processing and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). Indeed, ever since the birth of AI, creating a good chatbot remains one of the ﬁeld’s hardest challenges. While chatbots can be used for various tasks, in general they have to understand users’ utterances and provide responses that are relevant to the problem at hand. This proposed system Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) based generation models.  In proposed system, “Cornell movie dialog Corpus” dataset is acquired to train the model. This system is implemented by using PYTHON TENSORFLOW programming language.</span></p>
